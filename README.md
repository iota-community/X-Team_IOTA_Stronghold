## 🌳 IOTA NAME-HERE Initiative

The **IOTA NAME-HERE Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the IOTA Community by introducing consistent workflows around [IOTA NAME-HERE](https://link-to-blogpost or article) with content, and open source contributions.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) among each other for zero fees.

## 🎯 Initiative Goals

The IOTA NAME-HERE is in phase [alpha implementation, ready for review, research phase]. We are currently focused on improving the IOTA Experience around the following goals:
