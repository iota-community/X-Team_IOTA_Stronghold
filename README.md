## ðŸŒ³ IOTA Stronghold Initiative

The **IOTA Stronghold Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the IOTA Community by introducing consistent workflows around [IOTA Stronghold](https://blog.iota.org/stronghold-alpha-release) with content, and open source contributions.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) among each other for zero fees.

## ðŸŽ¯ Initiative Goals

IOTA Stronghold is in the Alpha phase. We are currently focused on improving the IOTA Experience around the following goals:

- Defining Frequently Asked Questions and Finding the Answers to them
- Verifying builds and benchmarks on a variety of hardware types and operating systems
- Recipes for using Strongholds

### Defining the FAQ

We are collecting Frequently Asked Questions, and want to provide answers to them. This is why we need you to help us by asking questions!

 - [x] [IOTA Stronghold FAQ Discussion](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/discussions/99)

### Verifying Builds and Benches

We need to ensure Stronghold and Crypto build everywhere, and to this are requesting your support in regularly verifying the compilation and benchmarking of Stronghold for different platforms.

- [x] [Verified Hardware Builds and Benches Discussion](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/discussions/101)

### Recipes for using Strongholds

We would like to collect common recipes for doing things with a Stronghold, such as properly deriving passwords for a password manager, using in a multisig environment, etc.
